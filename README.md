# 3D Modelization of My Neuroscience Findings 

This repository include 3D modelization of functional magnetic resonance imaging findings from published scientific articles in neuroscience.

## Neuroimaging Articles:
* **In Activation Studies**, Clusters in Red = Hyperactivation; clusters in Blue = Hypoactivation, compared to healthy subjects
* **In Connectivity Studies**, Edges in Red = Increased Connectivity; Edges in Blue = Decreased Connectivity, compared to healthy subjects
